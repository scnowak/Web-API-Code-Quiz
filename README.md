# Web-API-Code-Quiz
I am taking a code quiz.  I click the start button. Timer starts and I am given a question. Answer question. Given another question. Answer question incorrectly. Time is subtracted from the clock. All questions are answered or the timer reaches 0. Game is over. I can save initials and score.
